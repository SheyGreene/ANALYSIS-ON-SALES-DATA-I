# TASK 2

This task showcases my understanding of Excel formulas that were used to analyze the total revenue, total profit, average revenue, and highest profit generated by a sales dataset of six products sold in different countries under specific categories. A sales dataset provided by my coach was used here

# ACTIVITY

Determine the following from the dataset provided:
1. The total revenue and profit generated
2. The revenue and units sold for every order
3. The total discount given in dollars
4. The total number of sales recorded
5. The highest profit generated
6. The Sales range, if Low or High.

# SKILLS DEMONSTRATED

1. Data Manipulation
2. The use of the 'Sum' function
3. The use of the 'Average' function
4. The Use of 'Count' and 'Max' functions
5. The use of the 'IF' function

# DATA MANIPULATION

Total Revenue and Total Profit were generated by using the 'summation function'. 
This was done by:
'=SUM (highlighting the sales column containing the different prices of products sold)'
'=SUM (highlighting the profit column containing the different profits of the products sold)'

Average Revenue and Average Units sold were generated by using the 'average function'.
I calculated by:
'=AVERAGE(highlighting the sales column containing the different prices of products sold)'
'=AVERAGE(highlighting the units sold column)

The Total Discount was determined by using the 'sum function' across the discount column, then the cell was formatted from 'general' to 'accounting', and then the dollar currency symbol ($) was selected.

The Total number of Sales Recorded was determined by using the 'count function'.
I calculated by:
'=COUNT (highlighting the sales column containing the different prices of products sold)'

The Highest Profit generated was determined by using the 'MAX function'.
I calculated by:
'=MAX(highlighting the profit column to determine the highest value in this column)'

A new column called 'Sales Range' was created to determine the high and low sales. This was done using the 'IF function' to determine the values above and below the average revenue calculated.
These calculations can be found in the table above.

# CONCLUSION
I expanded my knowledge on Excel formulas with this task.
